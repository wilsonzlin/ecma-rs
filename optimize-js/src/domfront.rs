// A's dominance frontier contains B if A doesn't dominate B, but does dominate a parent of B.
// One way of thinking about it: it's the nodes immediately adjacent to the subgraph of A's domination.
// Another way to think about it: B is dominated by A if all of B's parents are dominated by A (see comments further up). On the other hand, if it's in the fringe, at least one parent is dominated by A, but not all of them.
